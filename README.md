# 42 Piscine - Learning Through Challenges 🏊‍♀️

This repository is dedicated to consolidating everything I’ve learned during my Piscine journey at 42. It’s also meant to be a helpful resource for both new and returning Pisciners who are embarking on this unique and intense learning experience.

## Navigating the Piscine 🚧

### Keep Swimming Forward 🏊‍♂️
In the Piscine, progress is key. Don’t stress about making everything flawless, and don't let yourself get stuck on one project for too long. The main goal is to keep moving forward, learning as much as possible along the way. If an exercise feels particularly overwhelming, it's okay to skip it. Moving ahead and coming back later when you’re more experienced is often the best way to reinforce the concepts.

### Stay Honest - Choose Real Learning 🎓
How can you solve something when you have no idea where to start? The answer: **use resources wisely**. But remember, copying answers directly won’t help you in the long run—understanding how and why something works is where the real learning happens.

## My Learning Method

```c
void my_learning_method()
{
    // Step 1: Attempt the Basics Yourself
    create_basic_structure();

    while (not_understood)
    {
        if (completely_stuck)
        {
            find_similar_solutions();
            read_and_analyze_the_code();

            if (starts_to_make_sense)
            {
                write_the_code_yourself();
            }
            else if (still_having_difficulties)
            {
                transcribe_existing_code(); // Helps with understanding concepts

                if (still_confused)
                {
                    copy_the_code();
                    run_it();
                    analyze_the_behavior();
                }

                if (struggling_to_grasp)
                {
                    use_debugging_tools(); // like Python Tutor or VS Code Debugger
                }
                try_to_rewrite_code_afterwards();
            }
        }
    }

    // Repetition Leads to Understanding
    if (you_repeated_enough)
    {
        knowledge_is_consolidated();
    }
}

## Useful Tools 🛠️

- **[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com)**: Great for visualizing step-by-step what each line of code does.
- **VS Code Debugger**: Helpful for inspecting your code while running it. The debugging tool helps you understand how the program flows and identify issues effectively.

## Practice Consistently ⏱️

Consistent practice is essential, especially with the exam exercises. Try dedicating some time each week to solving these. Practicing often is the best way to strengthen your skills. The Piscine exam isn't just a test—it's an opportunity to gauge how far you've come. [Here is a link to practice exercises](#).

## Enjoy the Process! 🌊🏆

> **Note**: If you’re looking to recreate the environment from school at home, consider using a Linux-based system. This will help ensure you’re accustomed to the same tools and commands used during the Piscine. [Here is a link with instructions on how to install Linux on a Windows machine](#).
