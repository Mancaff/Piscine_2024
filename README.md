# 42 Piscine - Learning Through Challenges 🏊‍♀️

This repository is dedicated to consolidating everything I’ve learned during my Piscine journey at 42. It’s also meant to be a helpful resource for both new and returning Pisciners who are embarking on this unique and intense learning experience.

## Navigating the Piscine 🚧

### Keep Swimming Forward 🏊‍♂️
In the Piscine, progress is key. Don’t stress about making everything flawless, and don't let yourself get stuck on one project for too long. The main goal is to keep moving forward, learning as much as possible along the way. If an exercise feels particularly overwhelming, it's okay to skip it. Moving ahead and coming back later when you’re more experienced is often the best way to reinforce the concepts.

### Stay Honest - Choose Real Learning 🎓
How can you solve something when you have no idea where to start? The answer: **use resources wisely**. But remember, copying answers directly won’t help you in the long run—understanding how and why something works is where the real learning happens.

## My Learning Method

```c
void my_learning_method()
{
    // Step 1: Attempt the Basics Yourself
    create_basic_structure();

    while (not_understood)
    {
        if (completely_stuck)
        {
            find_similar_solutions();
            read_and_analyze_the_code();

            if (starts_to_make_sense)
            {
                write_the_code_yourself();
            }
            else if (still_having_difficulties)
            {
                transcribe_existing_code(); // Helps with understanding concepts

                if (still_confused)
                {
                    copy_the_code();
                    run_it();
                    analyze_the_behavior();
                }

                if (struggling_to_grasp)
                {
                    use_debugging_tools(); // like Python Tutor or VS Code Debugger
                }
                try_to_rewrite_code_afterwards();
            }
        }
    }

    // Repetition Leads to Understanding
    if (you_repeated_enough)
    {
        knowledge_is_consolidated();
    }
}
